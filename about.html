        <p>
            This website was created as a character gallery showcasing some of my favorite champions
            from League of Legends. The goal of the project was to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
            by building a multi-page site with interactive elements.
        </p>

        <p>
            I chose these characters because I have spent a lot of time engaging with the League of Legends 
            universe and have grown to appreciate their lore, design, and the way each character plays.
        </p>

        <p>
            This project helped me better understand responsive layouts, dynamic content loading,
            and organizing code across multiple pages.
